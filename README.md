# Migration-Trends

### Creating the dataset
The dataset includes bilateral migration data and features of the origin and destination countries for five-year periods, 1990 to 2010.

A combination of:
* [Bilateral Migration Data](http://www.global-migration.info/)
* [World Bank Development Indicators](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=world-development-indicators)
  * Fertility rate: Total fertility rate represents the number of children that would be born to a woman if she were to live to the end of her childbearing years and bear children in accordance with age-specific fertility rates of the specified year.
  * Employment rate: Employment rate for ages 15-65 is the proportion of the population ages 15-65 that is economically active: all people who supply labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period.
  * GDP per worker: GDP per person employed is gross domestic product (GDP) divided by total employment in the economy. Purchasing power parity (PPP) GDP is GDP converted to 2011 constant international dollars using PPP rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP that a U.S. dollar has in the United States.
  * Primary enrollment rate: Adjusted net enrollment is the number of pupils of the school-age group for primary education, enrolled either in primary or secondary education, expressed as a percentage of the total population in that age group.
  * Working age population: Total population between the ages 15 to 64 as a percentage of the total population. Population is based on the de facto definition of population, which counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship.
* [CEPII](http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele.asp)
 * Distance: The distance in kilometers between all pairs of countries
 * Common language: A dichotomous variable indicating whether or not two countries share a common language, measured by whether at least 4% of both countries speak the same language.
